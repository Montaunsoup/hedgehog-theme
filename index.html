<h2 class="headline" id="background">Here are some reasons why hedgehogs are super cool:</h2>
<div>
    <ul class="ul" id="tribute-info">
         <li> <b> Erinaceinae </b> - Hedgehogs belong to a the family group Erinaceinae. They are not rodents but are more closely related to shrews, moles, and moonrats. 

         <li><strong> Nocturnal - </strong> They sleep during the day and are active during the night, so they can party all night.</li>
        
         <li> <b> Smile - </b> Just look at that smile!</li>

         <li> <b> Cuddly - </b> They can become cuddly when bonded with you.

         <li> <b> Hypoallergenic - </b> They hardly have any dander and are a great alternative to dogs and cats if you have allergies.
            
         <li> <b> Longevity - </b> They have a lifespan of about 7 years, which is a long time, comparatively, to small pets like rats.
        
         <li> <b> Politically Active - </b> They are so popular that in New Zealand a satirical political group tried to get a hedgehog elected to parliament.  
        
         <li> <b> Highly Influential - </b> The famous blue rodent from Sonic the Hedgehog is indeed, a hedgehog. </b>
        
         <li> <b> Tubing - </b> The act of domesticated hedgehogs getting their heads stuck in toiletpaper rolls is called tubing.
        
         <li> <b> Prickle - </b> A group of hedgehogs are called a prickle.
